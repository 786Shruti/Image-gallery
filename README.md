# Image Gallery

A dynamic and responsive image gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of an internship program to showcase the fundamental and advanced web development skills, following a multi-stage development process.

## Project Overview

The **Image Gallery** allows users to view a gallery of images, add new images by URL, and view images in a modal (enlarged view) on click. The gallery is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on desktop and mobile devices. Users can also persist their image gallery by saving images in local storage.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Dynamic Image Addition**: Users can add images to the gallery by providing a valid image URL.
- **Image Modal**: Enlarges the image when clicked, displayed in a modal for a more immersive view.
- **Data Persistence**: Images added by the user are saved to local storage, so they remain in the gallery even after refreshing the page.
- **Optimized Performance**: Lazy loading of images and minified CSS/JavaScript for faster load times.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the gallery.
- **CSS**: For styling, layout design, and responsive adjustments.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, form validation, local storage, and modal interactions.
